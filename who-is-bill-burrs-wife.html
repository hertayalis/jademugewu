But who is his wife, and how has she been able to tame ol’ Billy Boy?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Nia Renée Hill is an actress, writer, producer, and director who is best known for her work on Lila, Long Distance, Did You Look For Work This Week?, and the Netflix hit Santa Clarita Diet. She also appears on her husband’s animated show F is for Family. In all honesty, this article shouldn’t be titled Who is Bill Burr’s Wife?, but rather Why Nia Renée Hill is Badass!</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>Born in Boston herself, Hill isn’t shy about the love she has for her hometown. After meeting at Emerson College, Hill and Burr moved to Los Angeles to seek opportunities in show business. The pair struck up a long-term romance before tying the knot in 2013.</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>Hill has a devilishly funny <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter account</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> and often appears on Burr’s podcast Monday Morning Podcast, where she is referred to by Bill as “The Lovely Nia” and where the two go at each other like only a married couple can. One thing is certain: Nia is possibly the only person on Earth who is able to successfully roast Burr. Endlessly entertaining, it’s like listening to a WWE Grudge Match. Check out the harrowing 18 minutes below.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>Hill and Burr have two children together and love being parents. Incredibly private, they keep their kids out of the spotlight and quietly parent them behind the scenes. Like all parents, though, there are good times as well as bad ones. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Here’s</a> Burr talking about his daughter’s terrifying first movie experience. You win some, you lose some.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Hill is the definition of a powerful woman. She’s a mother of two, an entertainer, a brand ambassador, an activist, and does all of that work in spite of her famous husband and celebrity connections. She’s the type of person we should all aspire to be, except for the ability to berate Bill Burr. We’ll leave that to the expert.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlkp65rXnBrqmrq12stqexjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
