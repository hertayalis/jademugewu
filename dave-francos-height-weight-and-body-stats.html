Many have tried to discredit the claim, made by the actor himself, that he is actually 5ft 7in tall.</span></p><p><span>It could be camera angles or shoes, but until Dave tells us otherwise, we blindly believe him.&nbsp;Celebrities who share Dave Franco’s height include Justin Bieber, Tom Cruise, and Al Pacino.&nbsp;Yes, so it might not be as big as you thought, it might even be bigger than you thought, but now you know the facts.</span></p><h2><span>Dave Franco Weight</span></h2><p><span>It’s obvious when you look at the actor that he must have really good genes, a rad training regimen or a pretty strict diet.&nbsp;Going deeper into it, we discovered that it was a bit of everything.&nbsp;The actor weighs 68 kg (150 pounds), which you will find to be quite commensurate with his other stats.&nbsp;How does it achieve this?&nbsp;Well not by sitting on your butt all day or “acting” on the calories.</span></p><p><span>See also: Channing Tatum height, weight and body measurements</span></p><p><span>Dave trains three or four times a week to keep everything in place and all the slabs in check.&nbsp;He generally does not alter his diet, although he is generally repelled by all “white slime” foods, including mayonnaise and aioli, and even vanilla pudding.&nbsp;In relation to this, he said, “I’m a very adventurous eater otherwise.”&nbsp;We’re sure it’s portion controlled however, that toned body certainly wasn’t born of reckless eating.</span></p><h2><span>Dave Franco Body Stats</span></h2><p><span>The actor may not be as ripped as some of our bodybuilders out there, but he certainly takes care of business.&nbsp;We already know how much it weighs, so here’s the rest.&nbsp;The actor’s chest size is 42 inches, his waist is 32 inches, and his biceps are 14 inches.</span></p><p><span>These stats wouldn’t be complete without our “cherry on top” version, so here’s Dave Franco’s shoe size.&nbsp;He wears a US size 10, European size 23 and UK size 9.5.&nbsp;So there you have it, Dave Franco’s stats in a nutshell.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGickauybrLRmqWcp6Nitaa1xqGrZq%2BVnrSpwIyapZ1lkqSxunnSrZitq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
