That now belongs to&nbsp;@730hook!”</p><p>The surprising popularity of Hook has taken the wrestling world by storm. He’s only had one match, and he’s already got the best-selling t-shirt in the company. Tony Khan has to be happy. He considers Hook a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">major player in the promotion</a>.</p><p>Hook has appeared as a mostly silent member of his father’s stable, Team Taz. He was trained at the Nightmare Factory. He is a former division one lacrosse at Bucknell University.</p><p>The sky is the limit for the 22-year-old Hook. Very few wrestlers enjoy a debut as successful as the young AEW star. It will be interesting to see where his career trajectory takes him in the future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of Hook passing up CM Punk in t-shirt sales?
