Spurred by Lylla the otter, the animals decide to give themselves proper names instead of the number sequences their captors use to address them. According to a confirmation tweet from Gunn, Chaudhry is voicing Teefs, the walrus friend in the clip. From what we’ve seen so far, Teefs seems like a sweet, albeit dim, walrus who chooses his name based on his protruding tusks. It’s yet to be seen if Teefs and the rabbit Floor will make an appearance in the present, but as we know Lylla will show up, we think it’s likely we’ll see what happened to Teefs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>And Asim Chaudhry is Teefs. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dviKuXNzPo</a></p>— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=#>April 25, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=829 data-injectable=true>Chaudhry may best be known to audiences from his recent turn in Netflix’s The Sandman, based on the DC comic written by Neil Gaiman. In the show, Chaudhry plays Abel, one of the biblical brothers along with Cain. Unlike their biblical counterparts, the brothers (who are recurring characters in the original Sandman comics) perpetually reenact Abel’s murder at the hands of his brother while living in the Dreaming. Abel is kind to a fault and readily accepts his fate, acting as a foil for his bad-tempered brother.</p><p data-characters=688 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>While Chaudhry gained popularity for his role in The Sandman, he was acting long before the Netflix series. Along with his college friends — Hugo Chegwin, Steve Stamp, and Allan Mustafa — Chaudhry co-created the BBC mockumentary People Just Do Nothing. The show started out as a series of YouTube skits created by the friends before being picked up by the producer of the British version of The Office. Chaudhry starred as the eccentric entrepreneur Chabuddy G and leader of Kurupt FM, a pirate radio station in the mostly improvised series. The show lasted for five seasons from 2014 to 2018 and the actors reprised their roles in the 2021 movie People Just Do Nothing: Big in Japan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=false>The British comedian continued to appear in films and television after his show ended, notably in the 2018 short film Love Pool (which Chaudhry also wrote and directed), the made-for-TV comedy Click & Collect, and the interactive film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. With his new role in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Chaudhry is definitely one to watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXZm8pr%2BMmqqipV2YtaLBw6GpsmWgoa66ecinZKCtkaexqq3NrGSonl2ptaZ5xpqjmrCpYsOwuIxsZJqmlGLEqbHRnmShmaaaeqp50p6cp2WYnrpursSfpqudXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
