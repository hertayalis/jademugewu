During the events of The Clone Wars series, Anakin and his party, consisting of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka Tano, crash-land on the planet believed to be the place whence the Force itself originated, and it was here that they first saw the owl Morai, who kept the Daughter company.</p><p data-characters=44 data-current-count=44 data-injectable=false>But what function does the owl really serve?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-morai-and-did-she-appear-in-the-ahsoka-finale data-injectable=false><strong>Who is Morai and did she appear in the Ahsoka finale?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/themandalorian-1333425556659064833-20201130_150001-img1-1.jpg><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>After the Son (the manifestation of the Dark Side) kills Ahsoka, the Daughter urges their Father to transfer her remaining life force to Ahsoka, bringing her back to life. It is from there that Morai becomes attached to Ahsoka and tries to keep a watch on her. Morai had spiritual ties to the Daughter, and they passed on to Ahsoka when she was brought back to life from her powers.</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>The next time we see Morai, chronologically, is in the final season of Clone Wars when Darth Vader arrives to inspect the site of the Venator cruiser’s wreckage. After recovering Ahsoka’s blue lightsabers, Vader gazes up at the sky and sees Morai circling around the perimeter. Morai later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">helped the Ghost’s crew in their struggle against the Empire</a> and guided Ezra Bridger in the mystical area known as the World Between Worlds to save Ahsoka from her fight against Vader.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Where Ahsoka goes, Morai isn’t far behind. So it was hardly surprising to see her appear in the Ahsoka series finale, even if a little too briefly at that. It’s unclear what role Morai will play from here on out in the MandoVerse timeline, but we can’t wait to see more of her next to Ahsoka.</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=815 data-injectable=false>Dave Filoni has encouraged the comparisons <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">between Ahsoka in the post-Imperial timeline</a> and Gandalf the White, and since then it’s become something of a meme in the Star Wars fandom to associate Snips with the wizard from The Lord of the Rings. And just as Gandalf had a companion in Shadowfax, so does Ahsoka in Morai. In a way, this all helps sell the character as one of the last living members of the Clone Wars era, and quite possibly, the most experienced Force-wielder alive in that timeline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlkZ3AsLfArGSor5xiurC%2BwKJkmqaUYsSquMtmqqGdXZa9sbHAq2Sipl2ptaZ5wKGqqKORYsCxtc2onZ9n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
