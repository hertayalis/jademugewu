Kerrion added that the recording was recent and Kirk issued an apology once he started receiving backlash for the way he was heard speaking. The outrage against the musician continues to rage but his wife Tammy Collins too is being subjected to a lot of hatred on the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Many who have listened to the audio pointed out the cackling voice of a female laughing in the background during the entirety of the recording and a lot of them are of the belief that it is Collins who was sniggering. Collins is the stepmother of Kerrion, who was born in 1988; details of his biological mother are not known.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=#>Who is Kerrion Franklin?

They each had one child from their previous relationships at the time of their wedding - Kirk's son Kerrion and Tammy's daughter Carrington. Tammy is a former makeup artist and is best known as Kirk's wife.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple have two children together, a daughter named Kennedy and son Caziah. A report states that Kirk made a promise to Tammy during their wedding ceremony that he'd never cheat on her and uphold her at all times. Kirk once compared cheating on Tammy to cheating on God, while adding that he's not perfect but he does love his wife. "Men can be dumb at times, and want what's newer, fresher, or what our other 'head' thinks is better. To cheat on Tammy is to cheat on the Kingdom, my children and even you," he <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>.</p><p>Coming back to Kirk and Kerrion's dynamics, the two have been on the outs for quite some time. In 2018, the latter took to Instagram <a href=# rel=nofollow>accusing</a> his father of trying to have him killed. Earlier this month Kerrion also posted a cryptic message on Instagram that read, "I‚Äôm not allowed to have any childhood pictures of myself or my family. Some of the sh*t I see yaw complain about is so surface. I‚Äôve been through the fire.‚Äù</p><p>On March 13 he leaked a recording of the conversation where Kirk was cussing him out, the reason for the same is unknown as of yet. He used words like 'b**ch' and threats like 'I will put my foot in yo a**," amongst other things before hanging up. The video has been going viral on social media and Kirk began to trend heavily on Twitter post which he shared his apology with a plea for prayers for himself and his family.&nbsp;</p><p>However, people are as enraged with Tammy, who they believe should have tried to ease the situation rather than laughing in the background. "Kirk Franklin wife laughing in the background while she should've been trying to diffuse the situation. Evil...but it's not her son so she probably doesn't gaf. I seem them in a different light now," read a tweet. "That Kirk Franklin video is.. a PROBLEM. And his wife in the background cackling?! Whew," wrote another user. "If its MYOB Then why is kirk Franklin‚Äôs wife hysterically laughing in the background like anything that he is saying is remotely fucking funny. Clearly she‚Äôs laughing because that‚Äôs not her child, which goes to show the dynamic that they have in the first place," another tweet read. "Was that Kirk Franklin‚Äôs wife laughing in the background as he‚Äôs cursing his son, not hers, out? That‚Äôs a red flag also. You all are talking about his age as if bad parental behavior stops having an impact because of some chronologically ordered number," wrote another user.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Kirk Franklin wife laughing in the background while she should've been trying to diffuse the situation.
