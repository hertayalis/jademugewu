"She wants to focus on her clothing line right now. They're still friends and hang out."</p><p>The two were first spotted together in Oct. 2016 and were <a href=#>caught kissing at a Knicks game</a> a month later on a double date with Ashley's twin sister Mary-Kate and her husband Olivier Sarkozy. After relocating to a party, Ashley, 30, and Sachs, 58, were seen getting flirty. An eyewitness told Us Weekly, "Richard had his arms all over Ashley, kissing and [stroking] her hair. She was laughing and giggling."</p><p>Like her sister and Sarkozy, Ashley and Sachs had a significant age gap between them, as the fashion designer is 28 years the financier's junior. But that's <a href=#>not the only older man</a> that Ashley's been linked to. Before dating Sarkozy, Ashley dated painter George Condo, Moneyball (2011) director Bennett Miller, and businessman David Schulte.</p><p>The Olsen twins brought their S.O.'s to a friend's wedding in Mangawhai, New Zealand in late Feb. 2017. The sisters <a href=#>acted as bridesmaids</a>, wearing long black gowns and carrying a white parasol and bouquet of flowers as they walked together in the ceremony.</p><p>While Ashley may have ended her relationship, Mary-Kate's gotten even more serious in her own. According to reports, <a href=#>she's ready to start having children</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbmllaoRwrdKho56xXaS5tLHNZpmosZantqa6w2apopuYlr%2BledKamqGrXZiurbjEnWSqrZmpwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
