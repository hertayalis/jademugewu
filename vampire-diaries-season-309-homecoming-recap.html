With my luck you’ll go out and get yourself murdered by the homecoming queen.”&nbsp; This scene was more than amusing.&nbsp; The dynamic between Stefan, Damon, and Elena still keeps the plot interesting – even if the brothers have switched roles.</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>Caroline (<strong>Candice Accola</strong>) and Tyler (<strong>Michael Trevino</strong>) aren’t seeing eye to eye on the issue of blood drinking.&nbsp; It might be trouble in paradise in a major way.</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>Elena stops by to offer Rebekah some words of encouragement, and an olive branch – her mother’s necklace.&nbsp; Rebekah admits that this is her first high school dance and is a bit emotional.&nbsp; She pleads with Elena to not trust Michael and is obviously torn about her role in the plot to kill her brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief girl moment, Elena responds with a dagger in Rebekah’s back – looks like Elena’s willing to get her hands dirty if it means taking down Klaus.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Elena’s moment of bravery triggers her to question herself as the weak link in the plan.&nbsp; Damon comforts her, but it looks like he might have another plan up with sleeve that would keep Elena out of the picture all together.</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>The dance is conveniently relocated to Tyler’s estate after a water pipe bursts in the gym.&nbsp; It turns out the dance is really a wake thrown by Klaus to celebrate the demise of his greatest enemy, but his trust hasn’t improved much.&nbsp; He brought along his hybrid fan club to make sure&nbsp;the party doesn’t turn into a dud.&nbsp; When Tyler is brought into the loop, his first instinct is to get Caroline out safely and the only way he&nbsp;can think of – stabbing her with a vervain dart.
