If a recipe calls for a can of sweetened condensed milk, I am all in.</p><p>I once read that Martha Stewart keeps sweetened condensed milk in her refrigerator and her guilty pleasure is eating a spoonful of it late at night. Martha has never been so relatable to me.</p><p>She always loses me when she takes 15 minutes to fold a fitted sheet. I don’t have that kind of time Martha to waste on perfectly folding fitted sheets. Anyone else with me?&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-Layer-Magic-Bars-4-scaled.jpg alt="7-Layer Magic Bars.

I whip up these seven-layer bars, cut them up into pieces, &nbsp;place them in a large Ziploc bag, and throw them in the freezer. Then they can snack on them all day long. My daughter admitted to me at 4:00 pm that she had hardly eaten anything all day — except for the 7-Layer Magic Bars for breakfast. I had to laugh! You really ate the Magic Cookie Bars for breakfast? This is what happens when you live with me. 🙂&nbsp;</p><p>This is your fair warning that these 7-layer Hello Dolly Bars are highly addicting. You may not be able to stop at one. I played around with this recipe to get it just right to our liking.</p><p>These are very sweet bars so I like to sprinkle on a little sea salt to offset the sweetness. Plus it pairs so nicely with the butterscotch. Trust me on this one. Oh, and if you love nuts, feel free to add more nuts. They cut the sweetness too. You can use your favorite nut of choice — pecans or walnuts — or whatever your heart desires.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-Layer-Magic-Bars-10-scaled.jpg alt="7-Layer Magic Bars.

That’s it. If you own a food processor, it takes about 30 seconds to make the crust. If not, you can always buy the graham cracker crumbs and just stir them together with melted butter. If you are using graham cracker sheets, you can also place them in a bag and wack them with a rolling pin.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Press down the crust in a 9 x 13 pan</strong>. If you want to make things extra easy, line the pan with parchment paper or foil. If you use foil, lightly spray with non-stick cooking spray to make it easy to remove. <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0029JOC6I data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong><span>This is my all-time favorite 9 x 13 baking pan</span></strong></a></li><li><strong>Sprinkle sweetened flaked coconut all over the crust</strong>. Then sprinkle chocolate chips all over the coconut. You can do all semi-sweet chocolate, or half milk chocolate and half semisweet. It all depends on your preference. Then sprinkle with butterscotch chips and your favorite chopped nuts — pecans or walnuts.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Add a touch of sea salt</strong>. This is when the magic happens because it turns this sweet bar into a salty sweet bar and makes it that much better. Bake for about 20 minutes and then let them cool. Place in the refrigerator or freezer to allow them to set up before cutting them.&nbsp;</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-Layer-Magic-Bars-5-scaled.jpg alt="7-Layer Magic Bars.
