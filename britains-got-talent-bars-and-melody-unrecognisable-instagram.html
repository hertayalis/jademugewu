Over on their account, the boys, who now go by the name of Sprazzy D and CJgamer, have looked to have had an action-packed time of late, performing on stage, hanging out with friends – and even getting tattoos! Leondre in particular has grown up, and now sports a trendy new hairstyle. His long blonde hair is often styled in a ponytail in the snaps, while Leondre often sports a cool black cap.</p><p id=e1orqdpJZx3Q><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: Simon Cowell helps collapsed Britain's Got Talent contestant</a></p><p id=eAvRP2Yegzbe data-wc=8><strong>Bars and Melody are now all grown up!&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e1N81tpSKBEg data-wc=8><strong>The talented duo boast 1.2 million Instagram followers&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=et4ELflifrAV data-wc=12><strong>The pair are growing up fast - and are even getting tattoos!</strong></p><p id=e4u7bYeBIVa_ data-wc=66>The double act first met on Facebook before appearing on stage on Britain’s Got Talent, deciding to form a duo after sharing a passion and love for music. After performing their anti-bullying song, Hopeful, in their first audition, they received a standing ovation from all four judges – Simon, Amanda Holden, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon – who was bought to tears at the emotional lyrics.</p><p id=ebICxhgnAgBZ data-wc=14><strong>Bars and Melody were sent straight through to the semi-finals with their amazing performance</strong></p><p id=eI9s9DhI_Ftv data-wc=80>The duo’s debut song, Hopeful, was inspired by Leondre’s own experience with bullies. Talking to The Sun, he revealed that he used to get tripped up and kicked by a group of boys, and that he used to tell people that the bruises were a result of him playing sports, rather than admitting the devastating truth. Luckily, in the end, the talented rapper told his parents, admitting that when he did, he: “Broke down in tears and cried and cried.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2pvYGp%2Bdn%2BXcmxtZ5KntrWtyKeqZp%2BfqXq1rcuepa1lkpa%2FtHnAp5tmpZWhvKXFjK6lq52TpLSvtdKamaWdXZ67tMDAoKmapV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
