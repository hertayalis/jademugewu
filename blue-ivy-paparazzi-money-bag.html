Is Santa Claus real? Did someone <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/_femgod/status/1223105472393121793 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="steal my perfect attendance pencil" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">steal my perfect attendance pencil</a>? What do you mean Grandma "is in a better place"?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, being the offspring of music industry legends Beyoncé and Jay-Z presents another slew of unique challenges. For example, watching a basketball game with your dad suddenly becomes a photo op for all the paparazzi in the stands foaming at the mouth. Ethics be damned.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Blue Ivy attended the Los Angeles Lakers vs. Clippers game last Sunday with her dad, during which she showed off her blossoming style with a custom denim jacket and Fendi combat boots. While exiting the stadium, a nearby paparazzo badgered <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a31067353/blue-ivy-brown-skin-girl-naacp-image-awards/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the musician-in-the-making" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">the musician-in-the-making</a> with an unnecessarily urgent question.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"How much was in the bag?" the pap yelled over the noise of the stadium, pointing at a small clutch Blue was holding. "How much was in there?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Blue looked confused, but only for a second. "Nothing," she replied, shrugging. "There's nothing." Are you happy now?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A cuter moment occurred earlier during the game when Blue got to meet Lakers player LeBron James. At first, she was too shy to approach the six-foot-nine basketball champ and instead asked her dad to get her an autograph, according to a clip shared by ESPN. Jay-Z encouraged her to ask on her own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You want a ball from me?" James told Blue. "OK, I got you. ... You got school on Monday? By the time you get out of school on Monday, you'll have it."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
