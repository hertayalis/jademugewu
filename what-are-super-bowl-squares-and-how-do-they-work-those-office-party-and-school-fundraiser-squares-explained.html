Once you get the hang of it, you’ll no longer look like a deer in headlights when your coworker, friend, or relative asks if you’d like to “buy a square.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wait-back-up-what-exactly-are-super-bowl-squares data-injectable=false>Wait, back up – what exactly are Super Bowl squares?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Super-Bowl-Squares-.jpg><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>Super Bowl squares is a gambling game that relies on the score of the Super Bowl to determine who wins and who loses. While there are a few iterations of the game, some offering more complex rules than others, most players fall back on the basic version of the gambling game as it tends to be the one most commonly used in, say, office parties, with friends, or among family members at your average Sunday Super Bowl party.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>The game is nothing formal – just a sheet of paper with 10 vertical lines and 10 horizontal lines and the names of the two competing NFL teams written along the top and the side. A visual example can be seen above.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>The game requires no talent and no prior knowledge of football. It’s dependent on luck and luck alone. Think of it as the football equivalent of the game show Deal or No Deal: you make a guess and hope for the best.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>That’s not to say you can’t score big if you win. Typically, when you “buy a square” you can do so for $1, $5, $10, or however much is determined by the group you’re playing with. The cost of each square affects the total payout. That can be anywhere from $100, $500, or $1000, or anything in between or beyond. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-do-you-play-super-bowl-squares data-injectable=false>How do you play Super Bowl Squares?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>First and foremost, you have to buy a square. What does that mean? It means you pick a spot on the board where you’d like to place your name. The square in question – or squares if you buy more than one – will correspond to a vertical and a horizontal number along the top and side of the play sheet. Those numbers are typically picked out of a hat and written out in random, not numerical order.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>Those numbers are representative of the football game’s score. After each quarter, the square that corresponds to the current score – Chiefs 9, Eagles 0 for instance – is paid out to the person whose name currently resides in that box.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>If it cost $5 to buy a square then the first-quarter winner would receive $50, the second-quarter winner (or halftime winner) would receive $100, and the third-quarter winner would receive $50. The person whose name is in the box that corresponds to the game’s final score wins the jackpot. In this instance ($5/square), that’d be $300.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>There you have it. Super Bowl squares aren’t that scary after all, are they? Now it’s time to collect your quarters, rummage through your wallet, and get your play team in order.
