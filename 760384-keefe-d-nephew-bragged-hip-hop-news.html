According to him, informants gave authorities both Keefe D and Anderson's names in no time. Allegedly, Anderson had also returned to Compton after the shooting to boast about the crime. "Within the next few days, we start getting calls from informants. Our first ones were saying, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">'Hey, it's&nbsp;Keefe D.&nbsp;Orlando [Anderson]&nbsp;was a shooter.'</a> They're telling us that&nbsp;Bubble Up&nbsp;and&nbsp;Big Dre&nbsp;were in the car. This is days after informants telling us, and it's not just us. Other people had informants too," he recalls.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-robert-ladd-recalls-days-after-2pac-s-shooting>Robert Ladd Recalls Days After 2Pac's Shooting</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ladd also explains that in the days after the shooting, there was a lack of communication between the Compton PD and the Las Vegas PD, out of fear of information leaking. As a result, Compton PD wasn't notified that they should have been looking out for a white Cadillac, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the car returning to Compton was missed.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Days have gone by now, and all we're saying is, 'Come on man, we know the white&nbsp;Cadillac&nbsp;is coming back to the hood. If we knew there was a white Cadillac <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">we would've been looking for it</a>," he also adds. "I mean, in that type of aspect, maybe we could have caught him or even, uh, you know, found the Cadillac."
