He has been active in the music industry since 1996, but his career really began in 1998 after he signed a five-album contract with Bad Boys Records, which was worth millions and increased Shyne’s net worth substantially.</p><p>So just how rich is Shyne? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that Shyne’s net worth is over $2 million as of mid-2016, accumulated during a career technically spanning considerably less than 20 years in the music industry. Moreover, according to the aforementioned contract he also became the owner of two luxurious homes and three cars.</p><h3>Shyne Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Jamal’s father Dean Barrow was a senior minister in Belize, before becoming Prime Minister in 2008, however, he was never married to Jamal’s mother, Frances Imeon Myvette, who moved to New York City in 1982 leaving Jamal to be brought up by her brother – Jamal joined her in brooklyn in 1987.&nbsp; Shyne was discovered by Clark Kent, a hip-hop producer, who thought Shyne sounded like Notorious B.I.G., and he was quickly signed by Sean ‘Puff Daddy’ Coombs.</p><p>However, in 1999 Shyne was convicted of attempted murder following a shooting incident and sentenced to 10 years jail. At that time, his first album was due for release, and despite many doubts, in 2000 Bad Boy Records released Shyne’s first, self-titled album, which peaked in second position on the US R&B Chart, and in fifth position on the main Billboard Chart; it also achieved gold certification.</p><p>Shyne’s net worth benefited considerably, in fact while serving his sentence, Shyne managed to increase his net worth by signing a contract with Def Jam Records which was worth $3 million. While still in prison, Shyne has released his second album entitled ‘Godfather Buried Alive’ and a mixtape ‘Clinton Sparks & DJ Rukiz: Shyne – If I Could Start from Scratch’ in 2004. The album was very successful and reached the top position on the US R&B Chart, and third position on the main chart, plus again achieving gold certification. In addition to this, while still in prison Shyne released unofficial mixtapes entitled ‘The Truth: Advance’ (2001), ‘Lost Sons’ (2003), ‘Life After the Club’ (2004), ‘Lost Tapes’ (2004), ‘DJ Laser Presents Shyne – The Son of Sam’ (2009), ‘25 to Life Plus 9’ (2009) and ‘Suge White & Shyne – Best of Shyne’ (2009) and ‘DJ Messiah & DJ Antalive: Shyne 10 Years & Still Shyne’ (2009).</p><p>Shyne was released in 2009, and deported to his homeland Belize. Regardless, he signed a further contract with Def Jam Records, which increased Shyne’s net worth again. He collaborated with the musicians <a href=#>Matisyahu</a> and <a href=#>Lil Wayne,</a> but also increased his net worth with the unofficial mixtapes ‘Welcome Home (Best of Shyne)’ (2009), ‘Shyne’s Home (Oct. 6)’ (2009), ‘DJ Dizzy Donmez Hip-Hop Nights Shyne On’ (2010) and ‘The Shyning’ (2010).</p><p>Not satisfied with only music, Shyne launched his own clothing line named Gangland in 2013 which has also added to the overall amount of Shyne’s net worth.</p><p>In his personal life, Shyne had a relationship with Monay Hawkins, actually at the time of his offence, but there is no public information on any current relationship. Shyne has spent considerable time in Israel since his deportation.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.446536144578><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 8, 1978</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Belize City, Belize</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Record producer, Actor, Fashion designer, Music executive, Rapper</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Dean Barrow</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Moses Michael Levi , Jamal Michael Barrow</td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/originalshyne</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/90963372</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0796135</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Record Labels</td><td>Def Jam Recordings, Bad Boy Records</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Albums</td><td>Godfather Buried Alive, Shyne, The Truth (Real Advance Album), Mixtapes:‘Welcome Home (Best of Shyne)’ (2009), ‘Shyne's Home (Oct. 6)’ (2009), ‘DJ Dizzy Donmez Hip-Hop Nights Shyne On’ (2010) and ‘The Shyning’ (2010)</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/796135_Brian-Shyne/796135_Hard-Pill-2005.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqyfsqaVYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
