Back in the day, shows like Arrow and The Flash dominated prime-time TV slots with fast-paced action and gripping drama that had never been seen on TV superhero adaptations."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Back in the day, shows like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrow</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Flash</a> dominated prime-time TV slots with fast-paced action and gripping drama that had never been seen on TV superhero adaptations. But as time went on, budgets were slashed, and the people with all the ideas and flair jumped ship, leaving CW’s own “DCU” as a shell of its former self. Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl, and Batwoman all crashed and burned eventually — some sooner than others.</p><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>Now, only the remnants remain as the CW seems to churn out more and more bad DC content. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The response to Gotham Knights has been overwhelmingly negative for the most part.</a> It barely broke half a million viewers for the first episode of the season, and although there are still three episodes to go, it’s clear the battle has already been lost. At its lowest, the show received just over 300,000 viewers. But those viewers are obviously incredibly vocal, as well as loyal, as they’ve expressed support online as the future of Gotham Knights starts to look more and more bleak.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Misha Collins, who plays Harvey Dent, has thanked fans for their support, saying the response has been “really lovely.” The actor’s known to most as the angel, Castiel, from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Supernatural</a>, a good CW show. While speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook.com</a> showered further praise on devoted fans, some supporters have even gone as far as setting up a campaign to get the second season renewed. Collins went on to speak about a possible second season and how fan reactions right now are the best shot they have of getting renewed.</p><p>“It’s been really lovely to see the fans rallying to save Gotham Knights and to find that we, actors, on the show are kind of hitching our wagons to their horses. We’re like, ‘Yeah. Save Gotham Knights, everyone. Which is, I think maybe, a little bit backwards, but it’s just how this is organically unfolded, which has been kind of cool.”</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=false>While it’s great to see that the few people who stuck with Gotham Knights seemed to really enjoy it, the harsh reality is that the ratings are the deciding factor in most cases. Though the CW is no Netflix, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s a bit too trigger-happy at times,</a> it looks like the writing’s already on the wall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmqq2ZomK8p3nAZqueqqKer62xjJ2aZquVp7amv4yipWakmaOybrLOq2StoJVirrmxjK2fmqabqHqmwsSrsKimlWKzsL6MrZ%2BeZZ%2BjtLC1zaBkrK2gpbyzwIyiq2aZoKWus7HNraOyZZiWwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
