Despite this early success, he decided to step away from acting during his teenage years and has since pursued entrepreneurship.</p><p>His estimated net worth of over $4 million is largely attributed to his acting career during childhood, with several roles in films before his iconic part in “Star Wars”.</p><h3>Jake Lloyd’s Net Worth: $4 Million</h3><p>Jake Lloyd’s acting journey commenced in 1996 when he portrayed Jimmy Sweet in the medical television series “ER”. This was followed by his appearance as Jake Warren in the drama film “Unhook the Stars” the same year, after starring in four episodes of the series.</p><p>His recognition escalated with his role in the Christmas comedy “Jingle All The Way”, where he played Jamie Langston, the 9-year-old son of Howard Langston (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Additionally, Jake Lloyd appeared in the film “Apollo 11”, portraying Mark Armstrong, and in “The Pretender”, where he depicted young Angelo.</p><p>In 1999, he took on the iconic role of young Anakin Skywalker in “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace”, the first film of the “Star Wars” series. Subsequently, he was involved in five related video games and featured in another film, “Madison”, which was shot in 2000 but released in 2005. Two years after “The Phantom Menace”, in 2001, Jake decided to depart from his acting career. He expressed that the role of Anakin Skywalker had a detrimental impact on his childhood, leading to bullying from classmates and enduring around 60 interviews a day following his appearance in “Star Wars”. Eventually, Jake graduated from Carmel High School in Indiana and briefly attended Columbia College Chicago to study film and psychology but discontinued after the first semester.</p><p>Despite his departure from acting, Jake continued his involvement in sci-fi festivals. He also ventured into filmmaking, creating a promotional video for “Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones”. During the same period, in 2012, it was reported by Entertainment Weekly magazine that Jake was directing a documentary about Tibet and the refugees fleeing from Chinese persecution to India.</p><p>In 2015, Jake made headlines yet again when he was arrested for driving without a license, reckless driving, and resisting arrest. His mother attributed the episode to schizophrenia, stating that he had not taken his medication the day before. She also disclosed that Jake had previously exhibited signs of schizophrenia starting at the age of 19, and although he was seeking treatment, he resorted to violence, attacking her the night before the incident due to similar reasons. Jake attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to assume the alias Jake Broadbent during this time to evade media attention.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jake Lloyd</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 5, 1989</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Fort Collins, Colorado, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5′ 5″ (1.65 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Miscellaneous Crew</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Columbia College Chicago, Carmel High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Lisa Riley, Bill Lloyd</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Madison Lloyd</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>http://www.twitter.com/j_lloyd_10</a></td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td><a href=#>Jake Lloyd’s Profile</a></td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Race to Space, Madison, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, Virtual Obsession, Unhook the Stars, Apollo 11, Jingle All the Way</td></tr></tbody></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihmqOVYrmtu9idqmavlZa5tbSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
