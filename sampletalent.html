Bo's path has been nothing short of incredible, starting from his modest beginnings as a high school student making YouTube videos for pleasure.<p>Bo developed his enthusiasm for performing at a young age, moving from temper tantrums to school plays because he was born with a natural aptitude for it. Although his athletic phase was somewhat odd, he found comfort in the performing arts. Bo's apparent skill earned him praise from many relatives, who encouraged him to seek a career in the entertainment business.</p><p>Bo started studying music during his sophomore year of high school, teaching himself how to play the piano and the guitar. He started creating autobiographical music, incorporating humor into the lyrics like the real-life joke "My Whole Family Thinks I'm Gay." Bo boldly submitted two of his songs as videos on YouTube on December 28th, 2006. He had no idea that this action would change the course of his professional life.</p><p>Bo's films have been viewed an astonishing 169 million times worldwide over the last 10 years, making people giggle all around the world. His unbridled talent and humorous brilliance attracted the attention of the business, which led to a streak of successes. Just four days after turning eighteen, he set a record for the youngest individual to ever record a "Comedy Central Presents" special. Bo published his first EP, "Bo Fo Sho," under a four-year record deal with humor Central Records, and it immediately shot to the top of the humor album charts on iTunes.</p><p>Bo maintained his popularity with full-length albums, chart-topping performances, and accolades as his fan base and notoriety grew. He was recognized by Entertainment Weekly as one of the "12 Rising Stars of Comedy," and his Comedy Central special and film that he co-wrote for Judd Apatow cemented his position as a key player in the comedy world..</p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>How to hire Bo Burnham for an event</h2><p><b>Learn how to hire Bo Burnham or research availability and pricing for booking Bo Burnham to perform at a corporate event, fundraiser, private party, social media campaign, fair or festival, tradeshow or conference, endorsement project, or hire Bo Burnham as a guest speaker, please submit the form to our agency.</b></p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>Frequently Asked Questions about booking Bo Burnham to perform.</h2><p>Many performers, actors, speakers and other talent like Bo Burnham in certain cases will consider virtual appearances via live streaming.

"How much does it cost to book Bo Burnham for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Bo Burnham booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Bo Burnham charge for an event. An example fee to book Bo Burnham is in the starting range of $500,000-$749,000. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Bo Burnham for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Bo Burnham agent on your behalf if your funding is in place.

It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the Bo Burnham booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired.
