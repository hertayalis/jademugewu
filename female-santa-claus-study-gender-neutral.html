Of the 1,000 answers, 17 percent voted in favor of a gender-neutral Santa Claus, believing it to be the best strategy to modernize such an iconic figure. Moreover, 10 percent want to see a female Santa, though the vast majority (read: 72 percent) want the Christmas legend to remain male.</p><p data-characters=19 data-current-count=19 data-injectable=false>Via GraphicSprings:</p><p>We all imagine Santa as the bearded old man in his iconic white and red suit, black belt, matching boots and reindeer-drawn sleigh. But what if Father Christmas was rebranded for today? We asked people how they would modernize Santa. Based on the results, we’ve updated Santa’s winter wardrobe and transformed his transportation. In it, he ditches his iconic suit and adopts some skinny jeans, trainers, and a hover-board to name just a few.

Ol’ Nic was an extremely wealthy person, and devoted much of his time giving secret gifts to those who needed it most. And so began the legend of Santa.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>It’s a tale that has persisted all the way through until the current era, and while Coca-Cola is often credited with branding Santa – or even inventing him in the first place – the big, bearded Christmas legend has always been dressed in red, no thanks to cartoonist Thomas Nast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">back in the 1870s</a>.</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=121 data-injectable=false>But in this current age, do you believe<strong> Santa Claus </strong>should adapt with the times?
