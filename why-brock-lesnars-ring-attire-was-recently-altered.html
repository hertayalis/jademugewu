Lesnar and Jimmy John’s, a sandwich shop famous for their cold cuts and other goodness, have been in a relationship for years. The Jimmy John’s logo has appeared on Brock’s ring gear on many important events and printed on the back of his Suplex City shirts as well."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, that changed recently.</p><p>The <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a> noted that Brock Lesnar’s sponsorship deal with Jimmy John’s has expired. It was not renewed either. This is why the logo was missing from his trunks when he battled Finn Balor at the Royal Rumble.</p><p>Lesnar’s partnership with Jimmy John’s was grandfathered in and WWE let him keep the deal and promote them on television due to this arrangement. Now it looks like a space on Lesnar’s trunks could be on the market again provided WWE would allow him to take on a new sponsor while currently under contract.</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
