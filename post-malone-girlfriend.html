The rapper and singer welcomed his first child, a baby girl, in June 2022 and simultaneously announced that he was engaged to his girlfriend! While things are looking better now for Post (real name: Austin Richard Post), who is also showing off his dramatic weight loss since becoming a dad, fans are still curious to learn more about his fiancée, who keeps a very low profile."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Meet "Jamie!"</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Even as Post Malone has become more and more famous, he has worked hard to keep his relationship private. The singer almost never discusses his partner — who fans refer to as "Jamie" — so very little is known about their relationship.</p><p>However, when he announced the birth of his daughter, he did open up a bit about his personal life.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@aibesam href=#>@aibesam</a><p>Post malone with Jammie <a title=postmalone href=#>#postmalone</a> <a title=gf href=#>#gf</a> <a title=new href=#>#new</a> <a title=newgirlfriend href=#>#newgirlfriend</a> <a title=wife href=#>#wife</a> <a title=engaged href=#>#engaged</a></p><a title="♬ Congratulations - Post Malone" href=#>♬ Congratulations - Post Malone</a></figure><p>"I’m excited for this next chapter in my life.

I got to let her decide. I tried to play her some stuff but I can’t really tell what she’s into right now. ... I know everybody at the house plays it for her and hopefully, they’ll get stuck in her head. Kids love my music for some reason, which is awesome, so I’m hoping that she just goes with the flow on that one."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>He also described his little girl as "swaggy" and we expect nothing less from Post's offspring.</p><p>"She’s so cool.
