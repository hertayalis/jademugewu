The former gifted the latter a perhaps unexpected gift, which Underwood showed off on social media in May 2014. "Well, it's not every day @mirandalambert buys you a motorcycle!"&nbsp;she wrote on <a href=#>Twitter</a> alongside a photo of her riding the bike barefoot. "Next stop, motorcycle driving lessons!!!" she added, alongside the hashtag "#RansTheBest."</p><p>Lambert explained the decision during an appearance on <a href=#>"Good Morning America"</a>&nbsp;on June 3, 2014. "She was wanting a motorcycle and I wanted to get her something for all the work she's put in, singing on the record, doing the performances," she explained, joking she made it clear to Underwood that she would have to learn how to ride it properly and not blame her for any injuries. "She's been practicing, so I can't wait. She's gonna look hot on that thing," the "Platinum" singer added.</p><p>Lambert also shed more light on their collaboration, revealing it had always been a dream to work with Underwood. "She's such an incredible artist and such a great vocalist, so when I asked her I wanted it to be the right song," Lambert explained. "It's so fun performing with her. It's a blast. Girl power!"</p><p>Girl power, indeed! We love nothing more than seeing these two superstars support each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHFhbH10e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2itrOtzZ2YZqSRoq%2BmvtNmmKecXZius77InmSuppSav7i7zp2qZp6inrKvsNKhoKln</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
