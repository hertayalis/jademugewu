He co-wrote the 2004 film "I Heart Huckabees," and told <a href=#>Reel Talker</a> that the film was his first credit as a writer. Following that, Baena was working in studio writing jobs until 2014, when he wrote and directed "Life After Beth," a zombie-comedy with Plaza in the title role. Baena proves that he can wear many hats and loves involving his wife; he wrote and directed the 2016 film "Joshy," where Plaza played the character Jen. He co-wrote and directed "The Little Hours," about a convent full of nuns and, you guessed it, Plaza was a main character. He wrote and directed the 2022 rom-com "Spin Me Round," and Plaza's in that too.</p><p dir=ltr>So what's it like working as a couple? Baena told <a href=#>Reel Talker</a> that it was the best experience. "She's awesome," he said of Plaza. "I'd be working with her if she wasn't my wife, but luckily she's my wife." He added, "The opportunity to do something creative [together] where we're both fulfilled—how rare is that?" Plaza has said the same about working with Baena. "I think that when you're with someone that is in your field, they understand what you're dealing with on a deeper level," she told <a href=#>People</a>. But she said that it can get close at times, and so they're both aware of the importance of doing things separately from time to time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphbn53f46wn6hlmah6osHBq5yyZaChrrut0mafrquSlrulecmenZ9lkpayr62O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
