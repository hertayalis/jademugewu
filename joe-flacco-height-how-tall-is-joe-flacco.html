After transferring from Pittsburgh, he played college football at Delaware, where he was selected in the first round of the 2008 NFL Draft by t he Baltimore Ravens.</p><p>In addition, Flacco has played for the New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles, and Denver Broncos. From 2008 until midway through the 2018 season, he started for the Baltimore Ravens as their starting quarterback.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/21094156/e13o3lhwwwcvcd2csiui.jpg><p>During his time there, the team won two AFC North titles, made appearances in three AFC Championship Games, and defeated the San Francisco 49ers to win Super Bowl XLVII after the 2012 season.</p><p>After a postseason performance in which he tied Joe Montana’s single postseason record for touchdown passes (11) without an interception, Flacco was awarded Super Bowl XLVII’s MVP.</p><p>In the off-season, he inked a record-breaking $120.6 million six-year contract for quarterbacks. After a career-high 27 touchdowns and over 4,000 passing yards in 2014, Flacco was invited to the Pro Bowl; however, he declined since his wife was giving birth to one of his children that same weekend.</p><p>Flacco’s play started to deteriorate by 2017, and in 2019 he was traded to the Denver Broncos as a result of Lamar Jackson taking his starting spot due to a hip injury.</p><p>His playing career was cut short by a neck injury that occurred eight games into the 2019 season. The Broncos terminated him after deciding to start Drew Lock instead of him.</p><p>After that, he signed up with the New York Jets as Sam Darnold’s backup, eventually starting for the Jets. That offseason, he signed a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, but after the latter lost starting quarterback Zach Wilson, he was traded back to the Jets. The Jets resigned him for the 2022 campaign.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Flacco holds the record for most career throwing yards and touchdowns among quarterbacks who have never been to a Pro Bowl as of the 2022 NFL season (he was invited to the 2015 Pro Bowl after the 2014 season, but he turned it down). In addition, Flacco is renowned for possessing one of the NFL’s strongest arms.</p><p>Flacco re-signed with the Jets on March 16, 2022, for a one-year, $3.5 million contract. Because Zach Wilson, the team’s starter, was injured, he was named the starting for the first three weeks of the season.</p><p>The Jets fell 9–24 despite Flacco starting the opening game against his old team, the Baltimore Ravens, and completing 37 of 59 passes for 307 yards, a touchdown, and an interception.</p><p>In the second game of the season, Flacco ended with 307 passing yards and four touchdowns in the Cleveland Browns game.</p><p>Flacco’s 66-yard touchdown pass to Corey Davis with 1:22 remaining in regulation gave the Jets a 31–30 lead. The Jets then successfully recovered an onside kick, which allowed Flacco to score another touchdown with 14 seconds remaining.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/21094121/i-1-1-1024x576.jpeg><p>His first successful start since the 2019 campaign occurred. Before the week eight matchup with the New England Patriots, on October 30, Flacco was dropped to the third string in favor of quarterback Mike White.</p><p>Flacco was designated the starter for the season finale after Zach Wilson and Mike White started from Week 4 through Week 17. White was ruled out due to five broken ribs. Flacco signed a contract to join the Cleveland Browns practice squad on November 20, 2023.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOmnmWWoa6kr85mn56hl53BbrTOsGStmZyheqq%2FjKOmnmWWoa6kr85o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
