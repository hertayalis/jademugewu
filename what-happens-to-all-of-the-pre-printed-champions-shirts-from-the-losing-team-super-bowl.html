Source: Getty ImagesDo you ever wonder how a team manages to print winning Super Bowl champions shirts for all the players the second the game ends?
Well, they don't. In fact, shirts are pre-printed declaring each team the winner, but only the actual winners and their fans will end up donning the coveted merch."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"It's a fantastic opportunity and the start of a great relationship where we could do a lot of good for people through the teams that don't win."</p><p>In a January 2024 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Good360 shared that the losing team's hoodies and hats end up in other countries like Europe, Africa, or Asia — but fans aren't going to see the shirts or merchandise anywhere in the U.S.</p><p>Interestingly, the process of putting the merchandise in the right hands is more fraught with potential problems than you might think.
