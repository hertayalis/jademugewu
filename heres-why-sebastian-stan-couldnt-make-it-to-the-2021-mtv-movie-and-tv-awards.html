"Sebastian couldn't be here because he's off being a rockstar. If you haven't seen the pictures of him on Instagram, he's truly a rockstar," he <a href=#>explained</a>. The pictures he referred to are two that Stan shared on his Instagram account showing his head-turning <a href=#>transformation into Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee</a>. One photo also showed him <a href=#>posing with Lily James</a>, who is playing actor Pamela Anderson alongside Stan in the upcoming biographical drama "<a href=#>Pam & Tommy</a>."</p><p dir=ltr>Once Mackie cleared up Stan's absence, he gushed over his co-star and friend, and even poked fun at him. "It's really amazing because <a href=#>he's one of my dear friends</a> and the two of us really enjoyed doing this show. We had a great time. We jogged together. We ate a lot of protein together. We laughed at each other," he recalled. He continued, "He locked himself in his room and I banged on the door and finally stole all of his luggage so he had to come out of his room to get clean clothing, but it was a great time."</p><p dir=ltr>Mackie then thanked his fans before concluding his speech with a shout out to <a href=#>Elizabeth Olsen</a> and <a href=#>Tom Holland</a>. "I'm so happy and I appreciate so much the fact that you guys love the show so much. There's more to come," he teased.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlhbIB6e8eeqZ6rXay1unnSnpmaq6Serq950q2Yp2WTpMKtsM2tZKaZm5p6qsCMraZmrJiaenN8kWpkpqymYrqwwsieZJqmlGLBt3nAsJirnKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
