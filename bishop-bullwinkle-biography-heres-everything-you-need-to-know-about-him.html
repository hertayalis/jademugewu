</strong>2024-07-22</div><p><span>In today’s society, it is rare to see someone who is ready and willing to speak out against the evils that occur in our communities, especially when it comes to the church.&nbsp;Bishop Bullwinkle is an American singer who has used his music to talk about the evils in the church and the kind of hypocritical pastors that are rampant now.</span></p><p><span>He used social media (YouTube) to post his videos which gained a lot of viewers.&nbsp;These videos speak out against the cover-up of pastors and warn people to be vigilant not to fall for the whims of these so-called gospel preachers.&nbsp;Read on for detailed personal life and other facts about Bishop Bullwinkle.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Bishop Bullwinkle</span></strong></h2><p><span>Bishop Bullwinkle, also known as Bull Winka is a popular soul singer born on August 22, 1948 in Tampa, Florida.&nbsp;His real name is Bernard Thomas and before becoming famous, Bullwinkle worked as a pastor at a church in Alabama.&nbsp;There is no information about his educational background.&nbsp;Moreover, almost nothing is known about the love life of the man, his parents and siblings.&nbsp;Nevertheless, here is what we know about him.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What you need to know about Bullwinkle</span></strong></h2><h3><span>His rise to fame</span></h3><p><span>Bishop Bullwinkle is an American soul singer and got huge amount of attention from all over the world thanks to a video he posted on his YouTube channel which went viral and was watched by a lot of people.&nbsp;This made it more popular even though the video was received with mixed reactions from viewers based on individual reasoning and interpretation of the facts it presented.&nbsp;The title of the song and video was ‘Hell 2 Da Naw Naw’ and in the video, Bishop Bullwinkle, dressed in a white suit and wearing sunglasses with a white hat, addressed the issue of hypocrisy in the church.</span></p><p><span>The video had over 3.5 million views and over 4,000 likes in a short time after its release.&nbsp;The song was about the hypocrisy of preachers and what is happening in many churches today that many people ignore.&nbsp;He implored the use of a different approach to reveal the long awaited truth of certain acts that are happening in so many churches today.</span></p><h3><span>A preacher slept with his wife</span></h3><p><span>In the song, he cited the fact that many pastors and bishops don’t do what they are supposed to do.&nbsp;He said some go after the money they receive from the congregation and some even go so far as to take advantage of single sisters, married women and widows.&nbsp;In his next song titled “Some Preacher”, Bishop Bullwinkle also exposed the corrupt facts happening in the inner circle of the church.&nbsp;He even mentioned the fact that he was also a victim.&nbsp;a preacher, like the one he described in his song, slept with his wife.</span></p><p><span>Bullwinkle believes in calling things what he sees them.&nbsp;He is a man who is not afraid to speak his mind.&nbsp;He is very bold and has shown how much he hates the hypocrisy that reigns in the church today.&nbsp;So he thought of a way to expose these issues to society and this is what earned him the fame he enjoys today.</span></p><p><span>Despite the fact that there are churches (and pastors) guilty of the things mentioned by Bishop Bullwinkle, there are very good pastors and preachers who are always interested in preaching the Gospel with sincerity and who really care about interest and welfare of their followers.&nbsp;So it will be unfair to label all preachers as hypocrites, but at the same time people need to be aware of all these evils so that they can become aware of them and not fall prey to the hands of these scammers.</span></p><h3><span>What has he accomplished?</span></h3><p><span>Bishop Bullwinkle has made several public appearances as a singer.&nbsp;On March 4&nbsp;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;2017, he was scheduled to appear at the 13th Annual Chi-Town Blues Festival at the Star Plaza Theater in Merrillville, alongside Clarence Carter, Sir Charles Jones, Theodis Ealey and Denise Lasalle.&nbsp;In June 2017, he had been invited to participate in the Southern Soul and Blues Lovers festivals in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.</span></p><p><span>He posted another video of an 86-year-old grandmother dancing to his song, like his other videos, also went viral and garnered over 10,893,615 views and 186,611 likes.&nbsp;It was also played on NBC.</span></p><p class=postsid
