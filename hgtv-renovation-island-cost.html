Source: InstagramHGTV's Renovation Island was an instant hit when the show aired in the United States, but many people are wondering how much money was funneled into building the resort.
The show follows Bryan Baeumler, a licensed contractor, and his wife Sarah Baeumler, who’s a designer. The couple moved to San Andros Island, Bahamas — with their four children — to completely renovate a rundown 10-acre building into a luxurious hotel."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Absolutely everything.”&nbsp;</p><p>The two had only six months to renovate the property into the Caerula Mar Club, and many people doubted them. “Everyone said we were crazy,” Sarah said. “But our hearts said ‘yes’ — this is the right thing to do.”</p><p>When speaking about their finances for the project, Bryan admitted they were in “pretty deep.” The couple bought the property for $2 million with the intention of spending $4 million for renovations alone. Bryan said that they more than doubled that estimation before the resort opened, meaning they likely spent around $10 million for the entire project.</p><p>Many fans of the show dream of visiting the island and the Caerula Mar Club, and many make their dreams a reality — the resort is open to the public.</p><p>"It's the first project on HGTV where viewers will actually be able to come down and see the final result, and hang out with us and the entire family," Bryan said in an interview with the Edmonton Journal.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>For our American friends: We can finally let the coconut out of the bag...’Island of Bryan’ will begin airing on @hgtv US as ‘Renovation Island’ - premieres June 7th @ 8pm, don’t miss it!!!#RenovationIsland #IslandOfBryan #YouAskedForIt @caerulamar @sarahbaeumler</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Bryan Baeumler</a> (@bryanbaeumler) on May 7, 2020 at 2:32pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">'Renovation Island's Caerula Mar Club has been impacted by the coronavirus.</h2><p>Unfortunately, Bryan and Sarah ran into even more financial troubles when the novel coronavirus pandemic hit, forcing them to shut down for months.

It was all about Family, friends, adventure, and the pursuit of happiness. Thank you to each and every one of you that was a part of it!! In 2020, I’m going to try to do more of some things, and less of others. Be less judgemental, and more understanding. I’ll try and stop doing a few things, and start doing a few other things. I’ll try to worry less, and care more. I want to wish everyone out there all the health, happiness and prosperity that 2020 can bring. If by this time next year I can still feed my Family, support my friends and inspire others to grab their dreams by the coconuts...it will have been a good year. It may seem like there’s such a big World out there, but it’s actually very small - so be nice to each other. #HappyNewYear #Bye2019 @caerulamar</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Bryan Baeumler</a> (@bryanbaeumler) on Dec 31, 2019 at 4:04pm PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Caerula Mar Club was also affected by Hurricane Dorian.</h2><p>Right before the pandemic, the couple had quite a scare when it appeared their island would be hit by Category 5 Hurricane Dorian. Luckily, their renovations remained intact as the hurricane spared San Andros Island.</p><p>“We were actually on vacation with the kids in an RV in the Pacific Northwest, when [Dorian] was heading straight for the hotel. We had to have that conversation, like, when we get back there we might just be sorting through debris for personal effects,” Bryan said in an interview with TheWrap.</p><p>Bryan continued: “But it curved north and hit Abaco and Grand Bahama. And, originally, we traveled back there and were relieved it hadn’t hit us, but we realized that the people of the Bahamas — and the Family Islands, especially — have family all over the place. So a lot of our employees and our friends there had families that had been directly affected or lost lives in the hurricane.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>For our 🇨🇦 friends - UPDATE - $CAD at par offer coming soon!!
