Besides, Healy is too tragic and salacious a character not to discuss.</p><p>Born in Texas, Healy was a talented comedian, actor, and vaudeville performer who had a successful career –- he even influenced legendary comedian Bob Hope, according to <a href=#>Empire</a>. But Healy was a mean drunk. His on-stage act of verbally or physically assaulting his stooges wasn't too far from the real-life truth. Shemp was so sick of Healy's drunkenness that he quit and went out on his own. When the stooges were offered a contract that didn't include Healy, the former star allegedly completely lost it, threatening to bomb theaters showing the Three Stooges, although this is disputed in Healy's biography <a href=#>Nobody's Stooge</a>.</p><p>Three years later, Healy was doing fine without the Three Stooges. His new film The Hollywood Hotel had a successful premiere, and he went out that night for some drinks at the Trocadero night club in Los Angeles. Shortly thereafter, Healy wound up in his hotel room, beaten to a pulp. The next morning, he was dead.</p><p>Albert "Cubby" Broccoli, a filmmaker connected to the infamous mobster Lucky Luciano, admitted to getting in a fight outside the Trocadero with Healy that night. Precisely what happened and whether Healy was murdered remains a mystery, but his influence on the Three Stooges remains a lasting part of their legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkG5wampfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dqbWmedOhqZ6dXajBsLvGnqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
