Before Ego, only six <a href=#>Black women</a> had been hired as full-time cast members; for her, that math wasn’t adding up.<strong></strong></p><p>Although she didn’t secure the gig the first time, Ego didn’t give up on her dream of becoming number seven.</p><p>“The time I got SNL was not my first time testing for the show,” Ego told Distractify. “You get to do five minutes of characters — whatever you want to do with those five minutes. I mean, you could [do] stand up if you wanted to. I did sketch characters.”</p><p>“I wasn’t even thinking about whether I nailed it or not,” the SNL star added. “I was really just like ‘This is what I do. You might like it, you might not. Either way, fine by me.’”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span><p>Ego Nwodim as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and Kate McKinnon as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ego Nwodim is the seventh Black actress to *ever* join the cast of ‘Saturday Night Live.’</h2><p>Ego joined the cast of SNL in 2018.

The company’s new initiative promises a $5 million investment to philanthropists of color like Miss Diddy, DJ Mr. Rogers, Eric Hart Jr., and Katie Robinson of CodeCrew.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The Baltimore, Md.-born comedian said that when she was asked to join the campaign, she jumped at the opportunity to give back.</p><p>“SOLID BLACK aligns with how I operate in my own profession and how I fulfill my purpose in my own profession. It’s important to have Black voices showcased, it's important to hear from a diversity of voices.” Ego explained, “And so I was excited to jump on and be a part of SOLID BLACK this year.”</p><p>To learn how you can get involved, visit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doritos.com/SOLIDBLACK</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrSwec2wpp2hnWLAr7iMmqydoaSevK8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
