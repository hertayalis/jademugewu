Tommie does most of the talking, and accuses Yung Miami of writing some “weird a** s*** on the blog.”</p><p>Yung Miami and her friends are heard telling Tommie “it was funny.” Tommie responds to that with: “I’m never going to touch this b****.” She is then seen telling someone trying to hold her back to: “Get off.”</p><p>Twitter users claim Tommie is upset with Yung Miami because she wrote a comment about her on a blog. The drama comes less than a year after Tommie had a fight with Akbar V after saying she had “no endorsements.”</p><p>Most have come to the conclusion Tommie was “pressing” Yung Miami, but others are convinced LAHH star Santana was the person the feud was directed at.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-revealed-tommie-s-age-and-birthday>Revealed: Tommie’s age and birthday</h2><p>Tommie is 38 years old at the time of writing.
