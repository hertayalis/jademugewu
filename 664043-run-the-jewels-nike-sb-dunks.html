Run The Jewels delivered a blue and pink offering with the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Nike</a> SB Dunk Low. Furthermore, with the Nike SB Dunk High, they opted to go crazy with the materials, while also delivering some black and pink hues. Recently, they got to like up with Nike for a special video segment in which they revealed their design philosophy. Overall, these kicks are very unique to the group.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-run-the-jewels-x-nike-sb>Run The Jewels x Nike SB</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the video up above, El-P reveals that each shoe was meant to represent different eras of the group. For instance, he notes that the Nike SB Dunk Low pays homage to Run The Jewels 3. As he explains, the softer tones speak on a much moodier record. However, Run The Jewels 4 is much more in your face, which is why you get those harsh pink and black tones. Moreover, El-P goes on to speak about all of the little intricacies and how he really wanted to make these unique to the group. Overall, they accomplished that mission.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-run-the-jewels-x-nike-sb-dunks-release-date>Run The Jewels x Nike SB Dunks Release Date</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As it stands, <strong>these are currently on the market</strong> and they released on <strong>April 20th, 2023</strong>.
